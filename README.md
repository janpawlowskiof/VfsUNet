# VfsUNet (Variable Filter Size U-Net)
Repository used for bachelor thesis by Jan Paw≈Çowski.

VfsUNet (inspired by VRCNN and UNet) is an architecture for artifact removal on intra predicted frames
in HEVC. It is meant as a replacement for DBF and SAO filters.
Unlike VRCNN or VRCNN-BN this architecture is able to perform 
inference on 1280x720 input 30 times per second on a GTX 1060.

This version is tested in domain specific scenarios, meaning that
model is trained and tested on clips from one videogame
in order to simplify model's task and allow it to be more lightweight.

### Instructions

Needs to be added.
